## Overview

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com): [Project Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

This is a basic recipe website using basic HTML and CSS, with a main index page which will have links to the 3 recipe web pages

I am using a popular Bodybuilding Cookbook from Greg Doucette called [the Ultimate Anaboblic Cookbook 2.0](https://www.gregdoucette.com/products/cookbook-2) as a reference

I will be using 3 of his dishes that are readily available at his [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNAZHiu0ASAprWRUxQHAiHG1FhlJbyeIm)
