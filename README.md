## About The Project
This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com): [Project Recipes](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). This is a basic recipe website with a main index page with links to the 3 recipe web pages. I am referencing a popular Bodybuilding Cookbook from Greg Doucette called [the Ultimate Anaboblic Cookbook 2.0](https://www.gregdoucette.com/products/cookbook-2). I will be using 3 of his dishes that are readily available on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNAZHiu0ASAprWRUxQHAiHG1FhlJbyeIm)
